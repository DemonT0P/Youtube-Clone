# Youtube Clone

Live Version: https://demont0p.github.io/Youtube-Clone/

This Youtube Clone was made during the course [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=22307s&pp=ugMICgJwdBABGAHKBQxodG1sIGFuZCBjc3M%3D) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev).

I took the opportunity to learn about BEM methodology and SASS and use in this project.

## Requeriments

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Go to [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
